		<h2>Making an HTML5 Game</h2>
		<h5>Mar 2, 2018</h5>

		<h3>Design Decisions</h3>

		<h4>What am I doing?</h4>
		<p>I'm making a pure javascript HTML5 game from scratch, rendered on <span class="code">&lt;canvas&gt;</span>. I've always wanted to make a game, so once I got inspired by Ballz on iOS, I decided to make it. I love idle games and I think an idle game with
			just a little bit of skill could be interesting. Therefore, a game where you send balls out to bounce around to break a bunch of blocks sounds like a nice compromise between idling and doing.</p>

		<h4>Why am I blogging this?</h4>
		<p>I'm practicing making blogs and explaining my thought process.</p>

		<h4>Why from scratch?</h4>
		<p>The two tools that should be considered is a physics engine, a game engine, and/or an animation engine. First and foremost, I don't want to rummage through the different types of engines are research or try any of them. I want to get started right away.
			I believe the game is about on the level of cookie clicker which (I believe) was made from scratch, so I believe making my game in the same way is reasonable. I think that learning to implement the physics, rendering, and game loop myself will be useful
			for future projects.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>

		<h4>Files</h4>
		<p>Let's start simple and avoid build tools. I want to avoid a monolithic js file, so let's split up our game loop.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>index.html</li>
			<li>js/main.js</li>
			<li>js/game.js</li>
			<li>js/update.js</li>
			<li>js/render.js</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
